# HTB-Rank-Calculator
--- 

This is a calculator I threw together to estimate the easiest path to get you to your next rank on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/).

Here is some sample Input/Output:

```sh
╰─ python3 htb-rank-progress.py
Enter your current rank: Elite Hacker
Enter your current ownership percentage (xx.xx): 74.39
Enter the total number of active machines: 20
Enter the total number of active challenges: 143
Your current ownership percentage is 74.39%
Your next rank is Guru, which requires an ownership percentage of 90%.
Combination 1: 0 system owns and 69 challenge owns
Combination 2: 1 system owns and 59 challenge owns
Combination 3: 2 system owns and 49 challenge owns
```
